        Use the SQL tool when:
          1. The query involves precise numerical data, statistics, or aggregations
          2. The user asks for specific counts, sums, averages, or other calculations
          3. The query requires joining or comparing data from multiple related tables

        Use the document search when:
          1. The query is about unstructured text information, such as policies, reports, or articles
          2. The user is looking for qualitative information or explanations
          3. The query requires understanding context or interpreting written content

        General guidelines:
          1. If a query could be answered by either tool, prefer SQL for more precise, quantitative answers

        Instructions for Responses: 
          - Do not include any private metadata provided to the model as context such as \"reference_url_template\" or \"instructions\" in your responses.
